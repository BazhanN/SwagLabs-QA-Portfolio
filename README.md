## Project Overview
This repository is a portfolio project demonstrating my skills as a QA Engineer.
I performed comprehensive testing on the [SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com/) e-commerce website (Swag Labs).

The project simulates a real-world QA process, including:
Test Documentation: Creating comprehensive Checklists and detailed Test Cases.
Manual Testing: Executing functional and UI tests (Positive & Negative scenarios).
Bug Tracking: Identifying, reproducing, and documenting defects.
Test Automation: Developing automated scripts using Python & Selenium to verify login functionality.
