## Project Overview
This repository is a portfolio project demonstrating my skills as a QA Engineer.
I performed comprehensive testing on the [SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com/) e-commerce website (Swag Labs).
The project simulates a real-world QA process, including test planning, creating documentation (Checklists), bug tracking.
